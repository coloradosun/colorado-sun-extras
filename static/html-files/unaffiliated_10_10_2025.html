The Colorado Opportunity Caucus met at the ritzy hotel last weekend for a retreat that also included lobbyists. (Provided to The Colorado Sun)</p> &nbsp;<hr style="border-bottom: solid 2px #fcd232; border-top: none;">&nbsp; <p style="line-height:24px;"><span style="font-size:48px;line-height:12px;">A</span>t least 17 Democratic state lawmakers gathered with several lobbyists in Vail last weekend at a retreat organized by the nonprofit Colorado Opportunity Caucus.</p><p>The two-day gathering included “educational panels” and discussions, according to state Sen. <strong>Lindsey Daugherty</strong>, an Arvada Democrat who is chair of the caucus formed in January as a nonprofit. She said the purpose of the event was to “get a group of pragmatic, diverse legislators together to really talk about our goals for our caucus based on what we think the Colorado people really want and need.” </p><p>The Democratic lawmakers who attended the retreat included Daugherty and Sens. <strong>Marc Snyder</strong> of Manitou Springs, <strong>Kyle Mullica</strong> of Thornton, <strong>Judy Amabile</strong> of Boulder, <strong>Dylan Roberts </strong>of Frisco and <strong>Dafna Michaelson Jenet</strong> of Commerce City. Also there were Reps. <strong>Tisha Mauro</strong> of Pueblo, <strong>William Lindstedt</strong> of Broomfield, <strong>Michael Carter</strong> of Aurora, <strong>Jacque Phillips</strong> of Thornton, <strong>Meghan Lukens</strong> of Steamboat Springs<strong>, Matthew Martinez</strong> of Monte Vista<strong>, Katie Stewart</strong> of Durango, <strong>Sean Camacho</strong> of Denver, <strong>Rebekah Stewart</strong> of Lakewood, <strong>Karen McCormick</strong> of Longmont, and <strong>Cecelia Espenoza</strong> of Denver.</p><p>Lobbyist <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/lobby/ViewPrincipalResults.do?registrationId=20255085735&lobbyistId=20065000037" style="color: #003D5A;"><strong style="font-weight: 900;">Jason Hopfer</strong></a> — whose clients include the Colorado Association of Realtors, Xcel Energy, the private prison contractor GEO Group, and the Denver-based tech company Ibotta — attended the retreat. Other lobbyists present included <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/lobby/ViewPrincipalResults.do?registrationId=20255095000&lobbyistId=19897000274" style="color: #003D5A;"><strong style="font-weight: 900;">Patrick Boyle</strong></a>, whose clients include the cities of Cherry Hills Village and Greenwood Village and the Colorado Restaurant Association; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/lobby/ViewPrincipalResults.do?registrationId=20255086282&lobbyistId=20245002291" style="color: #003D5A;"><strong style="font-weight: 900;">Katie March</strong></a>, who represents GoWest Credit Union Association; and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/briantanner1/" style="color: #003D5A;"><strong style="font-weight: 900;">Brian Tanner</strong></a>, vice president of public policy for the Colorado Association of Realtors.</p><p>The Colorado Sun obtained photos from someone who spotted the group to confirm who was there.</p><p>Members of the Opportunity Caucus are considered among the more moderate Democrats in the legislature. The weekend retreat has stoked ire among Capitol progressives, who are quietly asking questions about who funded the gathering and its intent. </p><p>Daugherty said lodging, food and drink for the lawmakers who participated in the retreat — at least part of which was held at the ritzy Sonnenalp Hotel — were paid for by the Opportunity Caucus. </p><p>As a nonprofit, the Opportunity Caucus doesn’t have to report its donors. Nonprofits file annual financial forms, called 990s, that generally only include their total revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities.</p><p>Daugherty declined to name the group’s donors after being asked by The Sun, but she said they include business and environmental groups, as well as nonprofits. She also said members of the caucus pay dues.</p><p>“I don’t want to focus on who paid for it or the donors,” she said. “We were able to make sure that this group of legislators could come together to talk about what the Colorado people really need action on and how to keep the state blue.”</p><p>“We will file all the appropriate paperwork when we need to,” she added, referring to the group’s annual 990 tax form.</p><p>Dougherty pitched the gathering as a way to combat what she worries is the state’s drift away from Democratic control. She said the group wants to focus on “affordability, accessibility and accountability.”</p><p>“We are really, really concerned about the messaging and the Democratic Party as a whole, and we want to make sure that we continue to keep this state blue,” she said. “I’m proud of what we’re building, and I’m proud of the support that we have gotten so far. I think it shows that people really want legislators to work on the problems that the majority of our constituents are feeling right now.”</p><p>She said the lobbyists who attended were part of the “educational component of the retreat.”</p> &nbsp;<div style="border: 4px double #fcd232;padding:1em;"><p><strong>Welcome to The Unaffiliated, the politics and policy newsletter from The Colorado Sun. </strong>Each week, we take you inside the political arena to deliver news and insights on Colorado politics.

A lawmaker who is a scheduled speaker or participant at an event can also have a nonprofit organization pay for their "reasonable expenses,” but only if the nonprofit receives less than 5% of its funding from for-profit organizations.</p><p>Amendment 41 also bans lobbyists from giving any gift or paying for any meal or beverage for an elected official.</p><p>Daugherty said a lawyer, <strong>Scott Martinez</strong>, attended the retreat and ensured its legality. Martinez is a high-powered Democratic campaign finance expert who used to be Denver’s city attorney.</p><p>“We’re a 501(c)(4) organization, and we invited members to a training and educational event,” Daugherty said.</p><p>The state’s Independent Ethics Commission, created under Amendment 41, said Thursday that the commission had not received any inquiries about the Vail retreat.</p><p>The Opportunity Caucus formed with the help of another nonprofit political organization called One Main Street Colorado, according to the group’s director, <strong>Andrew Short</strong>. Short said the Vail retreat was not hosted by One Main Street, and the Opportunity Caucus is a separate, independent organization.</p><p>“They have their own board, set their own agenda, raise their own funds — and One Main Street is not involved in their operations or decision-making,” he said.</p><p>Like the Opportunity Caucus, One Main Street has in the past <a target="_blank" href="https://www.denverpost.com/2024/06/23/colorado-primaries-dark-money-spending/" style="color: #003D5A;">declined to name most of its donors</a> and has riled progressives in recent years by backing more moderate candidates in Democratic legislative primaries. </p><p>State Rep. <strong>Shannon Bird</strong> of Westminster, who was the caucus’ founding chair, did not attend the Vail retreat and did not respond to requests for comment. She’s running for Congress in the 8th Congressional District. </p><h4 style="font-family: 'Libre Franklin',Arial,Helvetica,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif; font-weight: 900; color: #d43f1f; padding-bottom: 6px;">OTHER CAUCUSES OPERATING AS NONPROFITS </h4><p>The Opportunity Caucus isn’t the only state legislative caucus that operates as a nonprofit. </p><p>The Colorado Democratic Latino Caucus nonprofit reported raising $38,284 in 2024 and spending $83,014, ending the year with $46,573 in the bank. The group raised $313,481 between 2020 and the end of last year.</p><p>The nonprofit didn’t disclose its donors in its 990 tax form. But when asked by The Sun, the caucus released a list of donors who gave at least $1,000 this year and last. It includes Amazon, Deloitte Consulting, SalesForce, the Colorado Beverage Association, Xcel Energy, DaVita, Sewald & Hanfling Public Affairs, and the Colorado Hospital Association.</p><p>Caucus cochair <strong>Julie Gonzales</strong>, a Democratic state senator from Denver, said the Caucus’ revenue also includes member dues.</p><p>“As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, the Colorado Democratic Latino Caucus has been intentional in maintaining clear boundaries between its official activities and the partisan electoral activities of its members,” the caucus said in a written statement. “CDLC exists to facilitate the work of its members within the legislature and connect Latino community with the legislature. We do not engage in electioneering of any kind. As a 501(c)(3) we have no requirement to disclose our donors, but are choosing to do so in the spirit of transparency.” </p><p>Some members of the Latino Caucus are also members of the Opportunity Caucus. </p><p>The Black Democratic Legislative Caucus of Colorado is also a nonprofit. Its 990 form isn’t publicly available and the group’s executive director, <strong>Ashleè Wedgeworth,</strong> said this week that she would share the tax document and a list of the caucus’ donors. However, she didn’t follow through.</p><p>Nonprofits are required by law to share their 990 forms upon request if they aren’t publicly posted.</p><p>In some years dating back to 2012, the Black Caucus didn’t file a full 990 form because it received less than $50,000 in donations.</p><p>The Opportunity Caucus is so new that it hasn’t filed a 990 form yet.</p></div></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:0px;padding:0px 0px 8px;word-break:break-word;"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" role="presentation" style="border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0px;"><tbody><tr><td style="width:300px;"><a href="https://cosun.co/3VWxSAq" target="_blank" style="color: #003D5A;"><img alt src="https://i0.wp.com/newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PDAB-UPL-300-x-250.gif" style="border:0;display:block;outline:none;text-decoration:none;height:auto;width:100%;font-size:16px;" width="300" height="auto"></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="font-size:0px;padding:10px 25px;word-break:break-word;"><div style="font-family:'Martel',Georgia,serif;;font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;text-align:left;color:#000000;">&nbsp;</div></td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="font-size:0px;padding:0;word-break:break-word;"><div style="font-family:'Martel',Georgia,serif;;font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;text-align:left;color:#000000;"><h3 style="padding: 16px 26px; font-family: 'Libre Franklin',Arial,Helvetica,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif; font-weight: 700; background-color: #fcd232; color: #111; font-size: 20px; text-align: left; text-transform: uppercase;">WHAT TO WATCH IN THE WEEK AHEAD</h3></div></td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="font-size:0px;padding:10px 25px;word-break:break-word;"><div style="font-family:'Martel',Georgia,serif;;font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;text-align:left;color:#000000;"><ul style="padding-left: 20px;"><li style="margin-left: 0; padding-bottom: 12px;">Colorado county clerks may begin mailing November ballots to voters starting today.

(Jesse Paul, The Colorado Sun)</p><p>Colorado Attorney General <strong>Phil Weiser</strong> said he plans to overcome his big name ID deficit in the Democratic gubernatorial primary the same way he did so in 2018 during his first run for elected office. </p><p>“The power of the network is how I won the first time,” he said of his campaign for attorney general eight-plus years ago. “When I started running in 2018, against someone named <strong>Joe Salazar </strong>with more name ID, we ran hard, we ran smart, we got our message, we won.”</p><p>Speaking to reporters this week after a campaign event in Denver, Weiser said he is building momentum “visit by visit, community by community.”</p><p>“That’s how we’re gonna run this campaign,” he said. “That’s how we’re going to win this campaign.”</p><p>The reality of the political dynamics is a bit more complicated. </p><p>At the time Weiser was running against him, Salazar was a state representative who shared a last name but no familial connection with <strong>Ken Salazar</strong>, a former interior secretary, U.S. senator and state attorney general. Weiser was dean of the University of Colorado Law School. </p><p>While Weiser is much better known this time around, <strong>Michael Bennet</strong>, Weiser’s primary opponent in the governor’s race, is a three-term member of the U.S. Senate and one-time presidential candidate who has benefited from tens of millions of dollars in campaign spending boosting his profile during his runs for office.</p><p>Weiser will have to make a lot of visits to a lot of communities to overcome Bennet’s deep-seated advantage. </p><p>At the moment, Weiser doesn’t appear bothered by the task. </p><p>“The number of current and former Colorado elected officials who have endorsed me is more than endorsed Michael Bennet,” he said after his event with former Gov. <strong>Roy Romer</strong> and former Denver Mayor <strong>Federico Peña</strong>, who have endorsed Weiser’s campaign. “These two individuals had a choice to make. Who’s the right person to be our next governor? The best thing for Colorado is to have me, Phil, as our governor, and to have Michael Bennet, with 17 years of experience, stay in the Senate, that’s the view that they hold. That’s the view I hold.”</p><ul style="padding-left: 20px;"><li style="margin-left: 0; padding-bottom: 12px;"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2025/10/07/michael-bennet-cellphones-ban-school-social-media-ai?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslocal_denver&stream=top" style="color: #003D5A;"><strong style="font-weight: 900;">Michael Bennet wants state ban on cellphones in Colorado classrooms</strong></a><br><strong>— Axios Denver</strong></li></ul><h4 style="font-family: 'Libre Franklin',Arial,Helvetica,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif; font-weight: 900; color: #d43f1f; padding-bottom: 6px;">WEISER GOING THE ASSEMBLY ROUTE</h4><p>Weiser told reporters he plans to get on the primary ballot by securing enough support through the Democratic caucus and assembly process next year.</p><p>“I’m going to win the state assembly, and I’m going to have top-line on the ballot,” he said. </p><p>Campaigns can make the ballot through the caucus and assembly process or by gathering signatures from voters in their party.

That leaves U.S. Rep. <strong>Diana DeGette</strong> as the lone Democrat in the delegation who hasn’t endorsed Bennet.</p><p>“Michael Bennet has been one of my most important mentors and allies and I have been on his team from the very beginning,” Pettersen said in a written statement. “After 15 years, I’m proud to be on his team as he runs for governor.”</p><p>There’s also a bit of palace intrigue that comes with Pettersen’s endorsement. </p><p>Her husband, Democratic strategist <strong>Ian Silverii</strong>, is Weiser’s lead campaign consultant. Additionally, Pettersen is on the short list to serve out Bennet’s term in the Senate should he win the governor’s race. </p><p>Pettersen acknowledged the political dynamics in her statement. </p><p>“Primaries can be grueling, and no matter who you support, we must remember that Michael and Phil are both great public servants and as Democrats we should proudly support our candidates with a positive vision that keeps us united in order to win next November and build the future our kids deserve,” she said.</p></div></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:0px;padding:0px 0px 8px;word-break:break-word;"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" role="presentation" style="border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0px;"><tbody><tr><td style="width:300px;"><a href="https://cosun.co/3Q4b1iF" target="_blank" style="color: #003D5A;"><img alt src="https://i0.wp.com/newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/UAF-Advertise.png" style="border:0;display:block;outline:none;text-decoration:none;height:auto;width:100%;font-size:16px;" width="300" height="auto"></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="font-size:0px;padding:10px 25px;word-break:break-word;"><div style="font-family:'Martel',Georgia,serif;;font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;text-align:left;color:#000000;">&nbsp; &nbsp;<div style="border: 4px double #fcd232;padding:1em;"><p><strong>Want to reach Colorado political influencers and support quality local journalism?</strong> The Sun can help get your message attention through a sponsorship of The Unaffiliated, the must-read politics and policy newsletter in Colorado.
